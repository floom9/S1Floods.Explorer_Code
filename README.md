# S1Floods.Explorer

This application is designed as part of a data science visualization project aimed at enhancing the visualization and knowledge surrounding the project S1Floods.AT, which TU Wien is a partner in.  
This repository only includes the code, as the data is private.  
However, data in the right format (check the README) can be included in the media/Data folder to test the program.

## Description

S1Floods.Explorer is an interactive web-based visualization tool created to improve understanding and accessibility of flood mapping data produced by TU Wienâ€™s algorithms. The main purpose of this application is to provide insights and simplify complex data for effective decision-making. This app was developed over several phases including conceptualization, methodology formulation, and validation.
